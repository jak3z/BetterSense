# BetterSense

I think this makes sense..? A simple mod that tries to make more sense to minecraft. 

**Is in beta.**

Requires: [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

## Features
 - WHY CACTUS DELETES ITEMS??!?
 - Stonecutter hurts *(Ouch)* and deletes items

## TODO

- [ ] Make configurable via commands
- [ ] Add language for death by stonecutter
- [ ] Optimize this lazy piece of code

## Contributing

I'm new to Java and minecraft modding and I don't know how mixins work so if you know and want to help you can open an issue or a pull request and I'll be very appreciative!
